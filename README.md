## About The Project

<img src="assets/featuregraphic.png" alt="App Feature Graphic" width="100%">

For this MAD Assignment, my team decided to create a productivity app, named Freeflow. ✌️
Freeflow aims to achieve maximum productivity and collaboration among users anytime and anywhere. 
Whether users are doing an assignment with your peers or if you're working with external organisations,
you can do it all on Freeflow. 


This enable teams/individuals to be more productive and efficient through: 🤩
* Creation of different workspaces to accomodate to the nature of the projects. 
* Creation of mulitple to-do taks within the workspace to achieve your goal.
* Categorization tasks for easier search and better productivity.
* Addition of collaborators to workspaces to work group projects.

Benefits of using Freeflow: 😎
* Handy productivity tool for everyone, no matter if you’re a busy student or a teacher with packed schedules!
* Users can automate routine yet necessary tasks such as project organisation and task deadline reminders.
* Helps users get objectives done with greater efficiency and less hassle.
* Takes stress off user’s minds when tracking tasks and important goals due for each project.
