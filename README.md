# Freeflow

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h2><img src="assets/appicon.png" alt="App Logo" width="27" height="27"> About Freeflow</h2>

For this MAD Assignment, my team decided to create a productivity app, named Freeflow. ‚úåÔ∏è
Freeflow aims to achieve maximum productivity and collaboration among users anytime and anywhere. 
Whether users are doing an assignment with your peers or if you're working with external organisations,
you can do it all on Freeflow. 


ü§© Work more efficiently by: 
* Dividing tasks into different workspaces to accomodate to the nature of the projects. 
* Adding mulitple tasks within the workspace to achieve your goal.
* Sorting tasks into categories for easier search and better productivity.
* Adding collaborators into workspaces to work together on projects.

üòé Why Freeflow:
* Handy productivity tool for everyone, no matter if you‚Äôre a busy student or a teacher with packed schedules!
* Users can automate routine yet necessary tasks such as project organisation and task deadline reminders.
* Helps users get objectives done with greater efficiency and less hassle.
* Takes stress off user‚Äôs minds when tracking tasks and important goals due for each project.
