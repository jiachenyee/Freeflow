## New Implementation

While reference from the popular social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Instagram, I decided to incorporate a chat functionality in this assignment 
to further improve the collaboration and efficient of a group task/project. To maintain the design and user interface of the app, I continue to stick to 
the accent colours and layout format of the other app pages. Throughout the entire assignment, I came up with two features of the new functionality as stated below. 

#### :speech_balloon: Task Messaging
- Send a message to the chat within each task.
- Receive realtime updates from Firestore whenever a message is sent.
- Get a notification if user has not interacted with the chat 

#### :eyes: View Account
- Click on any of the profile picture in the chat to view the specific profile.
  - An animation will play when user move from one activity to another. 
  
In the future, further improvements such as real time notification to update the user, uploading of images and documents as well 
as liking and deleting of the messages can be further added to this current functionality. Furthermore, while viewing the account 
details of other users, more information like the common workspaces or tasks which the other user and the current user are attached 
to, can be displayed at the whitespace found at the bottom. 
  


## Usage
- When user click on the chat icon, the app will bring him/her to the task messaging chat where they can view the interaction among other users.

- If the current user has not interacted with the chat (has not sent a message yet), then a notification will appear to introduce them to the messaging functionality.

- Just like any other chat, users can send any text messages freely across the chat without the worry of the data not being updated at real time.

- Any messages sent by the current user will appear on the right side of the screen in the accent colour of the workspace.

- The messages received from other users will appear on the left side of the screen with the username and profile picture attached to it.

- All messages will have the timestamp applied to it and the date will be displayed at the top of the first message on a new day.

- If the user wishes to view other userâ€™s account, he/she can simply click on the corresponding profile picture and an animation will bring he/she into the account page where he/she can view the details of that user.
